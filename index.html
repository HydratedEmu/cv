      <h3>Design, Develop, Manage</h3>
      <p>I began coding when I was 17 because I wanted to learn how games were made. One concept led to another and within a few years I learned how to 
		develop solutions for different industries. From setting up IT infrastructure such as networking devices and servers to developing mobile apps 
		that interact with your vehicle's internal network to designing custom PCBs.</p>

      <h3>Goals, Hobbies, and Passions</h3>
      <p>My current hobbies include 3D printing, video games like Fallout and Helldivers 2, fishing, and reading books (currently reading Dracula).
		I am passionate about technology and being hopeful that in my lifetime we can g to mars. My goal in life is to make my family proud 
	        and to live as an outstanding citizen</p>
